# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python through practical examples, including class design, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Smartphone Class Hierarchy
- Base `Smartphone` class with core functionality
- `GamingPhone` subclass demonstrating inheritance
- Methods for device management and app installation
- Example of method overriding and extension

### 2. Polymorphism with Animals
- Base `Animal` class with a `move()` method
- Multiple animal subclasses (`Fish`, `Bird`, `Snake`) with unique movement implementations
- Demonstrates runtime polymorphism through method overriding

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- No external dependencies required

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python OOP.py
   ```

2. Example Output:
   ```
   === Smartphone ===
   Razer Phone 2 with 64GB storage
   📲 Installed Angry Birds
   📲 Installed 🎮 Asphalt 9
   🎮 Gaming mode activated!

   === Polymorphism ===
   Nemo is 🐟 swimming in the water!
   Eagle is 🦅 flying in the sky!
   Python is 🐍 slithering on the ground!
   ```

## 🏗️ Project Structure
- `OOP.py` - Main script containing all class definitions and example usage
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Class design and instantiation
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Polymorphism in action
- Magic methods (`__str__`)
- Encapsulation of data and behavior

## 🧪 Extending the Project
Try adding:
- More device types (e.g., `Tablet`, `SmartWatch`)
- Additional animal classes with unique behaviors
- More complex class hierarchies
- Additional magic methods (e.g., `__add__`, `__len__`)
